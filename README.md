# Project_Deep-Learning-Gender-Classification-


## ABSTRACT:

Face is the most dominant part of human body and a lot of information can be extracted from facial
features. In this study deep learning models are used for classifying gender using facial images of male
and female and applying the same model to classify the born gender of people who have gone through
medical procedures to change their appearances and sometimes gender. The images were trained by
several models. The performance of the models when tested on the images of subjects without alteration
scored above 92%. The same models when tested on the transgender dataset were not able to reach the
same success. The best score was 25% which indicates that the model is not able to identify transgenders
born gender.
